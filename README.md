# Programming languages lab work

The course covers programming languages ​​in the context of building computer systems. The first two assignments are done in assembler, the following ones in C.

Required software:
- gcc or clang
- binutils
- gdb
- git
- nasm
- python (for tests for the first lab)
- for testing the C lab: clang-tidy, cmake, ninja-build
- emacs, vim, or another code editor. For C, a combination with clang's language server and an editor, or an IDE with it, works well.
